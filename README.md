# Portfolio-Site

~~A summary of all my work, also my first proper web-design project.~~
~~Check out the page for more info on me and my work/for my contact details. Its hosted at https://wil-ro.github.io/Portfolio/~~

This is an old website that I used to use to present my work online, I've since made a new site with its own fancy backend work. 
To find that see [www.rosia.me](www.rosia.me), feel free to download this and give it a look though, theres some css I'm really proud of in here
