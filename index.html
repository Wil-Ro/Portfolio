        An aspiring software developer who specialises in C++, C# and Python, with an intrest in lower level langauges like Assembly; 
        Most of my work is software based, with Python and C++, although I sometimes try game design with smalls groups of friends, in Unity, Unreal Engine and additionally, some solo level design in Source.

        Most of my current work experience relates to personal projects, however I have previously done work experience at jba consulting writing a
        program to convert their sql databases to excel spreadsheets. I also often teach Python and HTML, having taught many students at my schools coding club for over 6 years and having tutored 
        GCSE students briefly. You can see my full CV <a href = "pages/CVPage.html">here</a>.
