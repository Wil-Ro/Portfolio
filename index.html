        Most of my experience relates to personal projects, however I have previously done work experience at JBA Consulting writing a
        program to convert their SQL databases to Excel spreadsheets. I also often teach Python and HTML, having taught many students at my school's coding club for over 6 years and having tutored 
        GCSE students briefly. You can see my full CV <a href = "pages/CVPage.html">here</a>.
