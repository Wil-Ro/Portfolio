        Hey I'm Nye, welcome to my portfolio! I'm an aspiring software developer who specialises in C++, C# and Python, with an intrest in lower level langauges like Assembly. 
        Most of my work is software based, with Python and C++, although I sometimes dabble in game design with groups of friends, in Unity, Unreal Engine and some solo level design in Source. 
        When I'm not programming I'm most often drawing, playing board games, video games or baking.

    <div class = "textBox" style = "margin-bottom: 5vh;"> 
        Most of my skills relate to object oriented programming, a big focus of my work is creating intuitive systems that are both developer and user friendly and that work smoothy in all contexts.
        I love creating and working with large libraries and building intricate systems. The feeling of using systems and classes I or a close friend have built in an earlier part of a project is something I love, 
        remembering the thought and conversations had around how it works and seeing it interact seemlessly and efficiently with other parts designed separately. I imagine its how it feels to build the house you live within, each part 
        has a story and feels special to you on a personal level.
