        <div class = "textBox">
            This project was completed for my Extended Project Equalification (also knows as EPQ). During the EPQ, a student will pick a subject of their choice, research it and then either write a paper or create an piece of media 
            (an "artefact") based on what they have learnt. For my subject I originally chose physics simulation as at the time I lacked confidence in maths and wanted to force myself to relearn and become more comfortable with it. 
            The idea of combining VR with this later came about in an attempt to make the project more modern so more primary research and testing could be done.<br><br>

            The end result was a system that allowed the user to interact with a virtual environment with 6 degrees of freedom, they could pick up, move and throw objects with their fingers, hands and head being fully tracked to the 
            real world.
