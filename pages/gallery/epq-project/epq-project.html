            EPQ Project

        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <div class = "textBox">
            This project was completed for my Extended Project Equalification (also knows as EPQ). During the EPQ, a student will pick a subject of their choice, research it and then either write a paper or create an "artefact" 
            based on what they have learnt. For my subject I originally chose physics simulation as at the time I lacked confidence in maths and wanted to force myself to relearn and become more comfortable with it. However
            my supervisor pointed out that I would need to do something more unique that wasn't a common task among programmers. And this drew me to virtual reality (a relatively new technology in 2019, when this was being planned) 
            and I chose a new subject with my EPQ being titled "Self-Taught design for physics simulations in virtual reality" 
            <br><br>
            The majourity of my research revolved around vector maths and Unreal Engine. I chose Unreal Engine for my project due to its ease of use for prototyping with Blueprints and the fact it was programmed using C++, a language I had
            wanted to gain more experience with. I had not previously used Unreal Engine so spent alot of time looking at forum posts and tutorials as well as trying to create my own work and generally mess around with its systems. During
            this time I was using both C++ and blueprints although most of my focus was on blueprints as I found it kind of difficult to understand at first. My research into vector maths was something I struggled with alot and although I 
            managed to understand a decent amount of it, I found dot-products especially confusing which caused alot of issue since it was a relatively vital part of the calculations I would need for my simulation. After some struggle I started
            to realise I could use blender (a software I had been learning along with Unreal Engine) to help visualise vectors and the maths around them using its prodecural material system. This greatly helped me and is something I still return
            to every so often
