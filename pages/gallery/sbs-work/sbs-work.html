            <h2>What it is</h2>
            Inbetween my time at University and Post-16 I took a gap year where I interned at Skipton Building Society as a software tester. This was a paid 9 month internship where I pushed for automated testing
            with SmartBears TestComplete system and worked with their API team to ensure their software remained stable whilst they slowly worked through all their API's transitioning them from TIBCO to Azure. I was also asked 
            to research Gherkin and Behaviour Driven Development to see if it would be worth transitioning to. Helped to run a coding club to educate other members of the society

            <h2>What I did</h2>
            I was given test complete to mess with, learnt it within a few weeks and started creating experiemental tests for company websites. Later worked with another team member to educate other testers attended
            implement the software company wide. Presented the software to a large group of the company's developers
