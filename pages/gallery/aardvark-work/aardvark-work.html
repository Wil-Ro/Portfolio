            <h2>What it is</h2>
            Aardvark is essentially a virtual reality browser that allows developers to create apps that overlay ontop of any program they wish. Apps (or "gadgets") are created through panels that run webcode. These panels can also hold and
            interact with 3D models that Aardvark itself renders. This creates a sort of "mobile phone" like multi-tool that the user can access no matter what program or game they are using. <br><br>I was first introduced to Aardvark during its
            initial release as its developers organised a hackathon with the aim to encourage the development of apps for it, which I attented. At the time of the hackathon I had little development experience within HTML or Javascript so was rather
            out of my depth but as I have improved I have continued to revisit Aardvark.

            <h2>What I did</h2>
            During the first hackathon I proposed and worked on an audio visualiser tool that would run in the background of the users environment as they worked, reacting to their desktop audio. I also designed and created 3D models for other
            developers programs, such as icons for a playing card app; one of the first apps to be published on the platform.
