            <h2>What it is</h2>
            Aardvark is a development framework, currently in alpha, designed to allow users to open small apps (known as gadgets) over the top of virtual reality programs or games. You could think of it as a mobile phone for use within 
            any vr software, its main focus is providing small utilities such as calculators or note taking apps. Developers can create apps for Aardvark using web code which it then renders over the users view, these renders can be 2D 
            or 3D which is a rather big positive as steamVR doesnt support 3D rendering on overlays so Aardvark has to do this itself. Due to all the code being webbased and run on servers, all gadgets are innately multi-user (with a small amount
            of work from the developer) and when in social vr apps, people can open gadgets that will be seen by all other users within that program.

            I was first introduced to Aardvark through a hackathon the developers ran on its inital release to the public in an attempt to gain developers to create basic apps for it, and since then I have periodically revisited it
            when ideas for gadgets come to mind. When taking part in the first hackathon I had little to no experience with javascript or html, let alone typescript (the main language used for Aardvark development), so I was required
            to teach myself over the course of the 3 days the hackathon ran for.

            <h2>What I did</h2>
            During the first hackathon I proposed and worked on an audio visualiser tool that would run in the background of the users environment as they worked, reacting to their desktop audio. I also designed and created 3D models for other
            developers programs, such as icons for a playing card app; one of the first apps to be published on the platform. My audio visualiser never got finished due to my lack of experience with typescript and Aardvarks inability to 
            request desktop audio access at the time. Around 4 months later I revisited Aardvark to create a photo viewing app which was originally a personal project but became a team effort with another member of the community who offered 
            to join development, the app allowed users to upload images which were stored using ipfs and had multi-user functionality allowing different people to show each other photos. The main idea of the program was to allow vr artists to
            open reference images within their prospective drawing apps.
