                        First saw her in the Walmart pickin' out your drawers
                        Big Dolly Parton hair like an '80s prom queen
                        But her ass was lookin' good all up in them mom-jeans
                        I approached her in the checkout line, and said, "Yo baby, wassup?"
                        She had two gallons of milk, and I was starin' at her jugs
                        Five minutes later, she agreed to get with me
