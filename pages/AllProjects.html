                        An open source project, this was a platform that would run small web-based apps over the top of other virtual reality programs, like a form of augmented reality within vr. 
                        I helped produce apps, known as "gadgets" for the platform and created small additions to the main functionality of the program, adding a gesture system to allow the menu to be opened through hand gestures

                        Cat Tower Defence was a game made with a small group of friends in order to teach ourselves pythons "pygame" library, this was done over the course of a month or so and included some extra
